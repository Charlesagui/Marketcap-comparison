# Marketcap-comparison
This application, built using Streamlit, serves as a dynamic and interactive tool for cryptocurrency analysis and market potential exploration. It provides users with the ability to evaluate and compare cryptocurrencies based on specific metrics and hypothetical scenarios. Here are the key features of the application:

    Cryptocurrency Classification Based on Potential Growth: Users can input the symbol of a cryptocurrency to receive a classification score. This score is calculated based on the ratio of the circulating supply to the maximum supply, offering insight into the potential scarcity and growth prospects of the cryptocurrency.

    Detailed Cryptocurrency Data Display: Upon calculating the classification, the application presents detailed information about the selected cryptocurrency. This includes its current price, 24-hour price change percentage, market capitalization, 24-hour trading volume, circulating supply, and fully diluted market cap. This comprehensive data provides a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency's current market status.

    Market Cap Potential Estimation: A distinctive feature of the application is its ability to estimate what the price of one cryptocurrency (the base cryptocurrency) would be if it had the market cap of another selected cryptocurrency (the target cryptocurrency). This estimation offers users a speculative insight into the potential price elevation that could occur if the base cryptocurrency's market cap were to expand to the level of the target cryptocurrency.

    Historical Search Record Keeping: Each classification score calculation, along with the cryptocurrency symbol, is recorded in a CSV file. This functionality allows for the accumulation of historical data, providing users with the ability to review past analyses and observe trends over time.

This Streamlit application combines data fetching, processing, and interactive elements to create a user-friendly platform for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors, and analysts. It simplifies the exploration of cryptocurrencies' potential growth and market cap scenarios, making complex data analyses more accessible to a wider audience.
